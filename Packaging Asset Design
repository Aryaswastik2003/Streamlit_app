gd after all i am swastik  presenting you  a video for our The Packaging Asset Design platform.
so before starting lets see the prototype for better understanding.
we filled several columns for example l,w,h,weifht, fragility, etc 

and then ac to this it also give recomended insert desing and truck optimisation.

Purpose of this platform
The Packaging Asset Design platform  brings together crate design, insert generation, truck load optimization, and cost/CO₂ thus cutting logistics cost, CO₂ and product damage analysis into one unified cloud-based system.we get everything under this platform only.

earlier the main problem was 
 there was no unified cloud-based system existed..
 traditionally it takes the packaging engineers 1–3 days, but now the system delivers optimized designs in less than 5 minutes.
This speed enables faster iterations of work.



the platform is divided into 5 phase 
1. Input Phase: Part specifications, constraints, route details
2. Recommendation Phase: AI-powered container and insert suggestions
3. Design Phase: Detailed insert specifications with visual matrix
4. Optimisation Phase: Truck loading analysis with multiple scenarios
5. Export Phase: Complete packaging solution with specifications

for Technical Requirements we have:
Multi-criteria optimization considering dimensions, weight
Forklift availability impact on container selection
Stacking allowance considerations
Insert Design System
Matrix pattern calculation based on part dimensions
Truck Optimization
Space utilization analysis
Route-based optimization (Highway/Semi-Urban/Village distribution)


for outer boxes  We have only following  options  :
PLS, FLC, Foldable Crates, PP box 
all these are for different functionality for ex 
(PP Box) Weight capacity: 15-16kg
Foldable Large Containers (FLC) Weight capacity: 700-1000kg
PLS (Pallet & Lid Sleeve) Weight capacity: 450-600kg


Inserts:
we will be only focusing on PP inserts(PP = Polypropylene, a durable plastic material often used for making returnable inserts.
for Specifications the Weight capacity is 25-500kg



coming onto the Success 
The impact is clear and measurable.
Truck cube utilization can improve by at least 8%, ensuring higher efficiency in logistics operations.
Cost per transported part can be reduced by 6% or more, improving profitability.Sustainability targets are also supported, as CO₂ emissions per trip are lowered through smarter truck fill and packaging design.

Overall, the platform delivers tangible benefits for multiple stakeholders.
Packaging engineers gain speed and design support, logistics planners achieve better truck utilization, and sustainability leads can validate payback and emissions.
With scalability, cloud-native architecture, and AI-driven recommendations, the solution is well-positioned to drive digital transformation in the packaging value chain.
The first release is targeted for September 2025, marking a significant milestone towards efficiency, cost savings, and greener supply chain operations in the Indian automotive ecosystem.
